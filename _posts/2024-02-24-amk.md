In the realm of innovation, a lack of traditional funding can paradoxically fuel out-of-the-box discoveries. Financial constraints force out-of-the-box thinkers to explore new avenues, encouraging ingenuity and creative problem-solving. Without the safety net of funding, there's freedom from conventional expectations, encouraging risk-taking and unconventional approaches. 

The absence of funding also fosters a collaborative culture. Individuals sharing limited resources come together, leading to unexpected synergies and breakthroughs. This collaborative environment thrives on open-source sharing and mutual support, encouraging an unconventional approach that well-funded research might not.

This is the genesis of Automekin - a creation born at a time when our group was operating without any funding.
