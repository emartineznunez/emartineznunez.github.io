AutoMeKin is a computer program designed to discover reaction mechanisms in an automated fashion. Transition states are located using MD simulations combined with Graph Theory algorithms or via Heuristics. Microkinetic modelling one the obtained reaction network provides all sort of kinetic results. The only input needed is an initial structure in XYZ format. The method is described in these two publications: [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.23790) [2](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/cp/c5cp02175h#!divAbstract). At present [MOPAC2016](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac), [Entos Qcore](https://software.entos.ai/qcore/documentation/) and [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/) are interfaced with AutoMeKin.
