# Automated methods to discover reaction mechanisms

Over the last years we have been involved in the development of automated methods to discover complex reaction mechanisms. The methods are based on the use of molecular dynamics simulations, Heuristics and Graph Theory. The procedure has been applied to different systems and an open-source program is available: [AutoMeKin](https://github.com/emartineznunez/AutoMeKin).

The program and the underpinning methods are described in [this publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcc.26734)

# Energy transfer models in gas-surface collisions

An energy transfer model has been developed for gas-surface collisions. The model relies on simple gas-phase scattering models. When energy transfer is analyzed in the limit of high incident energies, the following results are found:

1. The percent of energy transfer to vibration (and rotation) of light diatomic projectiles decreases as the projectile’s mass increases, while this transfer is almost independent of the mass for heavier projectiles.

2. For small projectiles (less than 10 atoms), transfer to vibration increases as a function of the projectile’s size.

3. However, for larger projectiles, the percent transfer to vibration is nearly constant, a result that can be attributed to a mass effect and also to the fact that only a reduced subset of “effective” vibrational dof is being activated in the collisions

The MD results can be very well fitted to an equation that accounts for the adiabatic, low-energy, and impulsive, high-energy, collision:

$$
\langle \Delta E \rangle=\langle \Delta E^{ad} \rangle+\langle \Delta E^{imp} \rangle
$$
