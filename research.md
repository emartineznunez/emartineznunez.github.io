# Automated methods to discover reaction mechanisms

Over the last few years we have been involved in the development of automated methods to discover complex reaction mechanisms. The methods are based on the use of accelerated dynamics simulations and Graph Theory. The procedure has been applied to different systems and a computer program is available: AutoMeKin.

The cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation of ethylene has been studied with our procedure, explaining not only the major mechanism, but also side  reactions like hydrogenation. (Chem. Sci. 2017, 8, 3843)
